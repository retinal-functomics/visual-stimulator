# solutions_README

README can have a link to all the individual solutions files/documents and can/should be used to give an overview of the solution as well as the rationale behind its construction.

`solutions` should contain complete documents "how to do this" that reference individual folders with summarized descriptions and all necessary info. 
e.g. if you intend to do 2P imaging in mouse in conjunction with visual stimulation, you need board X, 3D parts Y and Z and arrange them XZY.. 

simple_lightcrafter_pattern-mode
outlines how to set up lcr using the gui to display video port-input as patterns; removes all image processing functions (info and caveats, see [README there](simple_lightcrafter_pattern-mode/README.md))
